    <li> Task: Implement a method that will return the approximate solution of a square linear system of equations where previous
         methods are not used. That is, inline the row reduction operations and the backsubstitution methods. Test the speed of the
         code you generated in this problem and the code that references your previous methods. Try this for increasing sizes of the
         linear system. You will likely need to use large systems of linear equations - possibly 10,000 by 10,000 to see any kind of
         time. Use cpu_timing methods in the language you have chosen to do your coding.

    <li> Task: Search the internet for sites that discuss the use of direct methods for the approximate solution of linear systems of
         systems of equations. Note that direct methods include factorization methods and the standard Gaussian eliimination with
         back substitution. Find at least a couple of sites where limitations of direct methods are discussed. As usual, cite your
         sites.
