    <li> Task: Implement a method that will return the approximate solution of a square linear system of equations where previous
         methods are not used. That is, inline the row reduction operations and the backsubstitution methods. Test the speed of the
         code you generated in this problem and the code that references your previous methods. Try this for increasing sizes of the
         linear system. You will likely need to use large systems of linear equations - possibly 10,000 by 10,000 to see any kind of
         time. Use cpu_timing methods in the language you have chosen to do your coding. Add a manual page to document the inline
         version of the solution process. Report any differences you see in the time it takes to solve the linear systems in the
         two approaches.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task: Implement a method that returns the LU-factorization of a square matrix. Add an entry to your software manual to
         document the method you have created. Hint: You can actually modify the Gaussian elimination code in two lines to come up
         with the new method.
    </li>
    <li> Task: Use the LU factorization method you created in the previous step, along with the forward substitution method (for lower
         triangular square systems) and the back substitution method (for upper triangular square systems) to create a method that will
         solve a square linear system of equations. Document the method in your software manual.

    <li> Task: Implement a method that will return a square diagonally dominant matrix. Document this method in your software manual.
    <hr>
    <li> Task: Search the internet for sites that discuss the use of direct methods for the approximate solution of linear systems of
         systems of equations. Note that direct methods include factorization methods and the standard Gaussian eliimination with
         back substitution. Find at least a couple of sites where limitations of direct methods are discussed. As usual, cite your
         sites.
