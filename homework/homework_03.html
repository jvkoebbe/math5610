    <li> Task: Email the link to your repository and table of contents for your completed homework tasks. I understand that this

         is a very easy task. Make sure that the link is an absolute link. The link should be to the username.github.io repository

         for the css formatted version.

    </li>

    <hr>

    <li> Task: Implement a method/routine that computes and returns the absolute error in the approximation of a number $x$ by

         another number $y$. Also create an entry for the method in your software manual.

    </li>

    <li> Task: Implement a method that will add two vectors of the same length. Also create an entry for the method in your software

         manual.

    </li>

    <hr>

    <li> Task: Implement a method that will return a scalar multiple of a given vector. The method should require a vector and number

         for the operation. Add an entry to your software manual for this method.

    </li>

    <hr>

    <li> Task: Implement a method that will compute the 2-norm of an arbitrary vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your

         for the method you create

    </li>

  

    <li> Task: Implement a method that will compute the 1-norm of an arbitrary vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your

         for the method you create

    </li>

    <hr>

    <li> Task:Implement a method that will compute the $\infty$-norm of an arbitrary vector will real number entries. Add an entry

         to your for the method you create

    </li>

    <hr>

    <li> Task: Write a routine that will generate a symmetric matrix that has real values in all entries of the matrix. Add an entry

         to your for the method you create

    </li>

    <hr>

    <li> Task: Search the internet for sites that discuss matrix norms. Look for sites that explain induced matrix norms. Write a

         brief summary of what you find. Limit the discussion to no more than two or three paragraphs and include links to the sites

         you cite.
