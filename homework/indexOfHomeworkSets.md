# Homework Sets and Computational Projects:

The following list provides links to the homework assignments to be completed by students in Math 4610 Fundamentals of
Computational Mathematics. The problem sets are geared to a one semester course. Due dates for all homework and projects are
set by the instructor for the semester. If you have questions, contact the instructor for the course you are taking.

# Presentations and Talks from Invited Lectures:

Over the past few semesters, faculty from the USU campus have been invited to talk about topics in computational mathematics during 
class time in Math 4610. The following provide links to slides that the speakers have used during their lectures. Note that the slides
have been exported to pdf when necessary.

## Spring Semester 2019:
