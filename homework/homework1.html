    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 1 Problems
  </h1>

  <ol type="1">

    <li> Problem: Write a code that will return machine precision for your computer (or any other computer for that matter) in
      single precision arithmetic. Give the method a name that is descriptive. For example, maceps(), or something like that.
      The routine should return the default machine precision. Create a second routine that will return the machine precision
      in double precision computations. Give the routine a unique name, say dmaceps(). Make sure that your code is fully
      documented with you as the author and so on. An example of a Fortran code is included in this repository. You can
      translate this into a Python, C, or C++ code to do the work. You can also modify the Fortran and use this directly.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Create a repository on [Github](https://www.github.com) and create a repositry for this homework that will
         contain a software manual for all the code you will write and work with in the course. The repository should include
         a table of contents where each entry in the table of contents is linked to a software manual page where the user can
         read about that entry. Start the software manual by creating software manual pages for the two routines using the
         template at the following link:
         <hr>
           <a href="https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/appendix02/softwareManualTemplate">
             Software Manual Markdown Template
           </a>
         <hr>
      Note: The software manual must use the template above to be graded!.
    </li>

    <li> Problem: To complete this problem, you may need to go to the Engineering Computer Lab on the third floor of the
      Engineering Building. If you have Cygwin installed on a laptop or desktop computer that you own, you can do this
      homework at home. Note that if you have some version of Linux/Unix on your computer, you can also do this homework
      using your own computer. Finally, if you are working on a MAC/Apple, you can also complete this problem using your
      laptop or desktop. Complete the following steps:
      <ol type="a">
        <li> Log onto a computer (Engineering Lab) and open a command terminal to work in. </li>
        <li> Upload/copy the routines that you created in the first problem. </li>
        <li> 
          Compile the routines into object modules (.o files). For example, put the files you have uploaded into a
          folder, say hw1_prob3, using the command
          <pre>
            % mkdir hw1_prob3
          </pre>
          and in a Cygwin/Linux/Unix operating system. Note that the "%" is the command prompt that may appear in the command
          terminal. Then use
          <pre>
            % mv *.f hw1_prob3
            % cd hw1_prob3
          </pre>
          to move all files ending with a .f suffix to the folder just created and change the working folder to the folder
          just created. Finally, compile the files using
          <pre>
            % gfortran -c *.f
          </pre>
          or
          <pre>
            % gcc -c *.c
          </pre>
          using the C-compiler in Cygwin. The result will be a bunch of object files with a suffix of ".o".
        </li>
        <li>
          The last step in this problem is to create a shared library from the routines you have created.      
          <pre>
            % ar rcv mylib *.o
          </pre>
          or  
          <pre>
            % ar rcv mylib *.o
            % ranlib mylib.a
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: In this problem you will learn a bit more about your computer and how many processes you can run on the
      cores included in your computer. You will use OpenMP to do this work.
      <ol type="a">
        <li> To start, write code like the following.
          <pre>
            program main
            print *, "hello world!"
            stop
            end
          </pre>
          to implement the good old Hello World introductory program. Compile and run the code you have created. The code
          should produce the string in the print statement. That is,
          <pre>
            hello world!
          </pre>
          Now, let's do a bit more with this example. We will need to add some code to the example to have each of the cores
          on your computer write out the same statement. In addition, the way that the code is compiled will also change.
          That we will do on the other side of the following code.
          <pre>
            |      program main
            |      integer id, nthrds
            |      integer omp_get_thread_num, omp_get_num_threads
            |C$OMP PARALLEL PRIVATE(id)
            |      id = omp_get_thread_num()
            |      print *, 'hello world from thread', id
            |C$OMP BARRIER
            |      if(id .eq. 0) then
            |        nthrds = omp_get_num_threads()
            |        print *, 'There are', nthrds, ' threads!'
            |      end if
            |C$OMP END PARALLEL
            |      stop
            |      end
          </pre>
          First, there are some things that need to be described in the code:
          <ol type="i">
            <li> The line on the left indicates how the code needs to be written in the column. In fortran, the comment
              line must start as the first character of the line typed in. So, the pipe, "|", is like the edge of the
              window and is not actually a character on your screen, just the border of the document.
            </li>
            <li> The string "C$OMP" tells the compiler that the line is a line associated with OpenMP. The first letter
                 must appear in the first column and indicates that when compiled without OpenMP extensions, will be ignored.
                 If the OpenMP library is available, the compiler will include the parameters contained in the comments. These
                 strings are the start of a "directive" to the compiler to do something.
            </li>
            <li> For the present time, (1) save the code above into a file named "hello.f", (2) compile the code above, using
              <pre>
                % gfortran -fopenmp hello.f -o hello
              </pre>
              and then run the compiled version of the code using the command
              <pre>
                % ./hello.exe
              </pre>
              Report the results of running the code.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: We will use Taylor series expansions in a lot of the work we do in Math 4610. Expand the following functions
      about the given center $x_0$. You can type this up using LaTeX or other word processor.
      <ol type="a">
        <li> $f(x)=sin(2x)$ and $x_0=0$ </li>
        <li> $f(x)=ln(2x)$ and $x_0=1$. Hint: Use properties of logarithms on this problem to make it easier. </li>
        <li> $f(x)=e^{2x}$ and $x_0=1$ </li>
        <li> $f(x)=3 x^2-2 x + 5$ and $x_0=0$ </li>
        <li> $f(x)=3 x^2-2 x + 5$ and $x_0=1$ </li>
        <li> $f(x)=(3 x^2-2 x + 5)^{-1}$ and $x_0=1$ </li>
        <li> $f(x)=cosh(x-3)$ and $x_0=1$ </li>
        <li> $f(x)$ and $x_0=a$ </li>
        <li> $f(a)$ and $x_0=x$ </li>
        <li> $f(a+h)$ and $x_0=a$ </li>
      </ol>
      Find the radius of convergence of each of the series.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Compute the following antiderivatives.
      <ol type="a">
        <li> $\int x\ sin(2x)\ dx$ (by parts) </li>
        <li> $\int x\ e^{x^2}\ dx$ (by substitution) </li>
        <li> $\int x\ e^x\ dx$ (by parts) </li>
        <li> $\int\ e^{x^2}\ dx$ (expand integrand in a Taylor series) </li>
        <li> $\int\ x\ \sqrt{1+x}\ dx$ </li>
        <li> $\int\ sec(\theta)\ d\theta$ </li>
        <li> $\int\ sec^2(\theta)\ d\theta$ </li>
        <li> $\int\ sech^2(\theta)\ d\theta$ </li>
        <li> $\int\ {{x^2+2}\over{7 - x^2}}\ dx$ </li>
        <li> $\int\ {{1}\over{a\ p - b\ p^2}}\ dp$ </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
         $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
      Write a routine that will return the roots of a quadratic polynomial in an array. Also, create a software manual entry for
      the routine and include this in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Compute the solutions for the following simple initial value problems:
      <ol type="a">
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=3 x$ and $x(0)=1.0$ </li>
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=3 t x$ and $x(0)=1.0$ </li>
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=0.1 x - 0.003 x^2$ and $x(0)=4$ </li>
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=0.1 x - 0.003 x^2$ and $x(0)=400$ </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Search the internet for an application that is influenced by machine precision. Write a paragraph on one of
      the results you have found. Identify one and only one such web site. Make sure that you cite the web site appropriately.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Graph the solutions of the last two differential equations in the Problem above. That is,
      <ol type="a">
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=0.1 x - 0.003 x^2$ and $x(0)=4$ </li>
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=0.1 x - 0.003 x^2$ and $x(0)=400$ </li>
      </ol>
      You do not need to recompute the solutions - just graph the solutions.
    </li>
